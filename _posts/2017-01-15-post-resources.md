<p>Tired of looking through your email inbox to find that file someone attached a while ago. In addition to providing document storage in your Project page Resources tab, CivNet now allows you to attach a resource to your post so you can reference it in conversation. You can attach these resources from existing files in your Resources tab or upload a new file that will automatically get added to the Resources tab for later reference if you're posting publicly.</p>
