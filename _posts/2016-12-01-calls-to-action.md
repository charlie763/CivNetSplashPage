<p>CivNet Calls to Action are tasks or activities you want people to do to help achieve your projects goals. Calls to Action can be anything from helping organize an event, writing an email to a city councilor, or giving input on the next steps of a community project. This 3 min video teaches you how to use Calls to Action on a Project page and create your own Calls to Action.</p>
