<p>Now, post to your Facebook profile, pages, and groups at the same time you're posting to CivNet. Our goal here is to make your life as a community organizer easier.</p>

<p>This feature allows you to:
	<ul>
		<li>Post to multiple Facebook pages at the same time</li>
		<li>Post images that will appear as if you were posting from Facebook</li>
		<li>Automatically link back to a CivNet Project page or Call to Action page on your Facebook post</li>
	</ul>
