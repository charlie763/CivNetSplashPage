<p>CivNet Projects are one of the basic ways you can interact with others on CivNet. They are an online project management system embedded in a civic and political network. Instead of completely siloing your internal and external communications, projects allow you to communicate more organicially and transparently, build capacity beyond the people you currently work with, and empower the people you work with to get more involved. This 2 min video teaches you how to communicate with your team, share resources, and create calls to action about tasks that need to get done.</p>
