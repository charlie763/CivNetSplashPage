<p>We've noticed that CivNet users don't always know who sees their posts and who gets sent email notifications from their posts. Watch the video below to learn how this works.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FCivNetCo%2Fvideos%2F1693357127345886%2F&show_text=0&width=560" width="560" height="315" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe>

<p>First, it's important to know that you have to post to a <a href="http://splash.civnet.com/blog/civnet-projects.html">Project</a> or a <a href="http://splash.civnet.com/blog/calls-to-action.html">Call to Action</a> on that Project. As a rule of thumb, unless you're posting from the homepage, people listed along the right sidebar of the page will be sent an email notification. Anyone who follows the same issues as the Project you're posting to will see your post. If you'd like to make a post private or if you'd like to make sure additional people get email notifications from our post you can also use the <a href="http://splash.civnet.com/blog/email-integration.html">Custom List Feature</a>.</p>
