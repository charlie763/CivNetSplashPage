<h3 class="blog_header_new_section">Democracy, the Crazy Uncle We Don't Like to Talk About</h3>

<p>In many ways, US exceptionalism is based on pride in our form of democracy. Granted that system of democracy originally excluded everyone except white men, our Founding Fathers created a revolutionary system of governance that has lasted over 200 years and inspired the current governments of numerous other countries. Yet, as Winston Churchill famously said, <i>"democracy is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried."</i> And we tend to treat it this way. Something we have to put up with. Something we ignore until things get really bad. Like someone addicted to smoking, we know we have bad habits, but we're unwilling to give up our addiction until we develop cancer and it's too late.</p>

<p>Investment in civic tech compared to general startup investment reflects this mindset. A <a href="https://www.knightfoundation.org/media/uploads/publication_pdfs/knight-civic-tech.pdf">2013 Knight Foundation report</a> tells us that $431MM was spent between 2011 and 2013 on civic technology. If you take out "peer-to-peer sharing", such as Uber and AirBNB, that number falls to $197MM (I'm not sure how much Uber helps democracy). In comparison, $1.5B was spent on artificial intelligence in the same time period; and in Q2 of 2016 alone, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-funding-trends-q216/">venture funding of artificial intelligence exceeded $1 Billion dollars.</a> Meanwhile, companies like CivNet generally try to raise $500K-$2MM for seed funding to create a viable product, whereas <a href="ttps://www.axios.com/the-tortured-history-of-the-uber-waymo-legal-fight-all-in-one-place-2349566425.html">Uber acquired Otto</a>, a company making self-driving car tech, for $680MM before they even had a finished product.</p>

<p>Now, I get it. As startup investors love to say, they are greedy capitalists. Improving democracy might be a laudible goal from a social perspective, but it doesn't make money. <!-- You gotta love the irony given the claim from so many startups that they are making the world a better place. -->
Aside from whether or not civic tech can make money, you'd hope the comparative levels of investment would better than 10:1 or in some cases 300:1 given the importance democracy plays in our society. After all, it's not like foundations are filling in the gaps. Only <a href="http://maps.foundationcenter.org">0.2% per annum</a> of total US grants go specifically to "democracy related" grants.</p>

<p>So where does that leave civic tech? It does often come down to that question: can civic tech make money? <img src="/images/screaming_person.png" class="blog_header_image_left"> I talk to a lot of investors who, at the end of the day, don't believe that there is enough <i>individual demand</i> for something like CivNet. "I just don't know if people <i>care</i> enough about making civic and political change," the refrain goes. Inwardly, I'm screaming. Outwardly, I'm trying to come up with a polite reply that challenges this notion but doesn't seem combative.</p>

<p>THE SINGLE BIGGEST LIE we have told ourselves in the past century is that people don't care. People may be overwhelmed by the amount of information out there today. People might not feel like engaging civically is worth their time given all the systematic barriers to making real change. People might feel powerless. But people care whether or not they get good healthcare. People care whether or not their children have a good education. People care about the social and political issues that fundamentally affect their lives.</p>

<p>CivNet, and civic tech in general, is going to succeed or fail based, not on it's ability to make people care, but on it's ability to help those who care effectively overcome systems that create barriers to making actual change. PEOPLE ALREADY CARE.</p>

<h3 class="blog_header_new_section">SO WHY MUSTACHES?</h3>

<img src="/images/mustached_constitution.png" class="blog_header_image"> 
<p>We live in an attention economy. There is a notion in the startup world that you need to create addictive, habit forming technology to succeed. Facebook's newsfeed was game-changing in that it provided users with <a href="http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/03/want-to-hook-your-users-drive-them-crazy.html">variable reward</a>. You keep scrolling because it's like playing roulette; you don't know what interesting new information is going to come next. Snapchat gives friends <i>fun</i> ways to alter the image of their face including mustaches, space helmets, and wreaths of flowers. Both these technologies cause their users to release enough endorphins that they want to come back again and again, and they invite their friends to adopt the same technology.</p>

<p>Sadly, CivNet and a lot of other civic tech do not run on mustaches. Case in point, CivNet's Advisory Board met recently. It was suprising that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/traviskellerman/">Travis Kellerman</a>, one of our board members most embedded in the traditional startup world, advocated the strongest against comparing our success to the success of startups like Facebook or Snapchat. He pushed us to define mission-driven metrics like <i>empowerment</i> and <i>collaboration</i>. After all, we are trying to solve intractable problems of democracy, not to create fun ways to put facial hair on your friend's face. YES, we should try to make democracy fun and engaging, but our goals are different than traditional social media, our method unique to our challenges.</p>

<p>Since this conversation, I've been thinking more and more that we need to move the conversation in civic tech away from creating <i>addictive</i> tech to creating <i>empowering</i> tech. MAU, or monthly active users for the uninitiated, are important, but only insofar has they tell us how well we are improving our democracy. CivNet seeks to improve democracy by doing two things: (1) empowering people to make change and (2) helping people act collaboratively towards collective change. Monthly active users may be important in that it helps us understand the potential size of collective impact. But we also define success by the particular mechanisms of change our technology facilitates. How many <a href="http://splash.civnet.com/blog/calls-to-action.html">Calls to Action</a> have people taken action on through CivNet? How many people have connected to other changemakers outside their existing network?</p>

<h3 class="blog_header_new_section">CivNet's Success So Far</h3>
<p>CivNet starts measuring success with the usual metrics. Over 1,500 people in the Albuquerque area signed up for CivNet in its first year. On average, over 25% percent of those people read CivNet's daily digest. 100-200 of those people are actively monthly and 10-30 people daily. But more importantly, people are taking meaningful action through the site. People have signed up for 813 Calls to Action including volunteering to organize events, calling and emailing political officials, or offering media support. In the second half of 2016, Calls to Action on CivNet found an average of 2.2 action takers. People are finding meaningful ways to create change through CivNet. With regards to collaboration, people have joined community projects on CivNet 3,187 times, and we're just beginning to learn how many of those people are new to the groups organizing those projects. Recently, two unaffiliated CivNet projects decided to collaborate by sharing an event space.</p>

<p>The numbers are backed up by what we're hearing from users:
	<p class="blog_quotation">When we posted our project on CivNet and put a call out for volunteers to help organize an event, we had someone step up who came from outside of any of our personal networks. This person turned out to be a powerhouse organizer who helped us pull off a great event.</p>
	<p class="blog_quotation">There is an intangible... It[CivNet] feels on some irrational level in tune with the needs of activists.</p>
	<p class="blog_quotation">A group of us decided that Albuquerque needed green bike lanes. We used CivNet to create Calls to Action, such as emailing the city councilor who represents Downtown Albuquerque... they are now much safer, as they have buffered bike lanes. MLK was recently repaved and portions of the widened bike lanes there now have green paint!</p>
	
	We think this is what success defined by democracy-based metrics looks like. It's not that monthly active users is unimportant. It's that metrics like empowerment and collaboration come first. When people feel empowered to create change they will come back to a platform because that platform is fulfilling a fundamental human need. And when you're fulfilling a fundamental human need, things like revenue and financial viability aren't too far behind. We think this is how success should be measured for civic tech.
