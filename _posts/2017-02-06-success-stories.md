<h3>Democracy, the Crazy Uncle We Don't Like to Talk About</h3>

<p>In many ways, US exceptionalism is based on pride in our form of democracy. Granted that system of democracy originally excluded everyone except white men, our Founding Fathers created a revolutionary system of governance that has lasted over 200 years and inspired the current governments of numerous other countries. Yet, as Winston Churchill famously said, <i>"democracy is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried."</i> And we tend to treat it this way. Something we have to put up with. Something we ignore until things get really bad. Like someone addicted to smoking, we know we have bad habits, but we're unwilling to give up our addiction until we develop cancer and it's too late.</p>

<p>Investment in civic tech compared to general startup investment reflects this mindset. A <a href="https://www.knightfoundation.org/media/uploads/publication_pdfs/knight-civic-tech.pdf">2013 Knight Foundation report</a> tells us that $431MM was spent between 2011 and 2013 on civic technology. If you take out "peer-to-peer sharing", such as Uber and AirBNB, that number falls to $197MM (I'm not sure how much Uber helps democracy). In comparison, $1.5B was spent on artificial intelligence in the same time period; and in Q2 of 2016 alone, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-funding-trends-q216/">venture funding of artificial intelligence exceeded $1 Billion dollars.</a> Meanwhile, companies like CivNet generally try to raise $500K-$2MM for seed funding, whereas <a href="ttps://www.axios.com/the-tortured-history-of-the-uber-waymo-legal-fight-all-in-one-place-2349566425.html">Uber acquired Otto</a>, a company making self-driving car tech, for $680MM before they even had a finished product.</p>

<p>Now, I get it. As startup investors love to say, they are greedy capitalists. Improving democracy might be a laudible goal from a social perspective, but it doesn't make money. You gotta love the irony given the claim from so many startups that they are making the world a better place.
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IXuFrtmOYKg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> Aside from whether or not civic tech can make money, you'd hope the comparative levels of investment would better than 10:1 or in some cases 300:1 given the importance democracy plays in our society.</p>

<p>But it does often come down to that question: can civic tech make money? I talk to a lot of investors who, at the end of the day, don't believe that there is enough <i>individual demand</i> for something like CivNet. "I just don't know if people <i>care</i> enough about making civic and political change," the refrain goes. Inwardly, I'm screaming. Outwardly, I'm trying to come up with a polite reply that challenges this notion but doesn't seem combative. <!-- When investors do invest in civic tech it is more often investment in apps oriented towards increasing the efficiency of government service delivery or developing apps for very specific civic functions like donating to causes. It is much rarer that you since investments in civic tech that seeks to improve the underlying systematic issues in democracy. --></p>

<p>THE SINGLE BIGGEST LIE we have told ourselves in the past century is that people don't care. People may be overwhelmed by the amount of information out there today. People might not feel like engaging civically is worth their time given all the systematic barriers to making real change. People might feel powerless. But people care whether or not they get good healthcare. People care whether or not their children have a good education. People care about the social and political issues that fundamentally affect their lives.</p>

<p>CivNet, and civic tech in general, is going to succeed or fail based, not on it's ability to make people care, but on it's ability to help those who care effectively overcome systems that create barriers to making actual change. People already care.</p>

<h3>SO WHY MUSTACHES?</h3>
[picture idea: mustache ove the constitution]

<p>We live in an attention economy. There is a notion in the startup world that you need to create addictive, habit forming technology to succeed. Facebook's newsfeed was game-changing in that it provided users with <a href="">variable reward</a>. You keep scrolling because it's like playing roulette; you don't know what interesting new information is going to come next. Snapchat gives friends <i>fun</i> ways to alter the image of their face including mustaches, space helmets, and wreaths of flowers. Both these technologies cause their users to release enough endorphins that they want to come back again and again, and they invite their friends to adopt the same technology.</p>

<p>CivNet's Advisory Board met recently. CivNet's Advisory Board is composed of leaders in the non-profit space, in the traditional startup world, in politics and community organizing. It was suprising that <a href="">Travis Kellerman</a>, one of our board members most embedded in the traditional startup world, advocated the strongest against comparing our success to the success of startups like Facebook or Snapchat. He pushed us to define mission-driven metrics like <i>empowerment</i> and <i>collaboration</i>. After all, we are trying to solve intractable problems of democracy, not to create fun ways to put facial hair on your friend's face. You'd think our goals might be different, our method unique to our challenges.</p>

<p>I think we need to move the conversation in civic tech away from creating <i>addictive</i> tech to creating <i>empowering</i> tech. MAU, or monthly active users for the uninitiated, are important, but only insofar has they tell us how well we are improving our democracy. CivNet seeks to improve democracy by doing two things: (1) empowering people to make change and (2) helping be act collaboratively towards collective change. Monthly active users may be important in that it helps us understand the potential size of collective impact. But we also define success by the particular mechanisms of change our technology facilitates. How many <a href="">Calls to Action</a> have people taken action on through CivNet. How many people have connected to other changemakers outside their existing network?</p>

<h3>CivNet's Success So Far</h3>

- Linda Thorne - asked 2.24
- Aryn/T.J. - asked 2.24
	""When we posted our project on CivNet and put a call out for volunteers to help organize an event, we had someone step up who came from outside of any of our personal networks. This person turned out to be a powerhouse organizer who helped us pull off a great event. That's a result that could have only happened on CivNet."
- Leila
- Michael Jay Tucker: "There is an intangible... It[CivNet] feels on some irrational level in tune with the needs of activists."
- Xavier and Support Local Foods
- Dan and Green Bike Lanes - asked 2.24
	"
"A group of us decided that since they were sprouting up all over America, Albuquerque needed green bike lanes. We originally focused on the Lead and Coal overpasses. We used CivNet to create 'Calls to Action', such as emailing the city councilor who represents Downtown Albuquerque and requesting that this be implemented. 

This was about 1 year ago and though there are currently no green bike lanes on the Lead and Coal overpasses, they are now much safer, as they have buffered bike lanes (bike lanes with an extra painted buffer between car traffic and the bike lane). However, MLK was recently repaved and portions of the widened bike lanes there now have green paint! 

The next big push: getting bike lanes on Lead and Coal between 1st and 8th."
