<p>Organizations function a lot like Facebook Pages. Individuals create Organizations, and they can add admins and editors who have access to posting as the organization and editing the organization's information. In addition, organizations allow you to share certain features with your core team. For example, you can share <a href="http://splash.civnet.com/blog/email-integration.html">custom lists of emails and CivNet users</a> to notify when posting as the Organization.</p>
