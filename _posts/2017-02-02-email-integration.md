<p>One of the big barriers people have had to using CivNet is that there's just too many other platforms out there. To help alleviate that concern we're building a number of features that integrate CivNet with forms of online communication you already use. Learn here how you can send email to lists of people at the same time you post to CivNet. This feature also allows you to send private posts and notify specific groups of people on CivNet. Next up, Facebook integration!</p>
